# TEXT--independent-Speaker-Recognition-and-Classification-using-KNN-Algorithm-K-s-Nearest-Neighbour-
Project implemented in MATLAB.
Here We have used the AN4 dataset (Alpha-Numeric) to Model our Speaker Recognition Project in MATLAB. It is text independent comprising of multiclassification among 10 speakers(5M,5F). The total dataset adds upto 125 Audio files used for feature extraction. Here we extract two features namely, MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients), and Pitch. We Have used inbuilt Machine-learning and statistics Toolbox of MATLAB to design our KNN prediction Model.
The dataset can be Downloaded with the Matlab file helperAN4download.m .
